Sales Data Analysis and Interactive Dashboard for Titash Products - 2023
Author: Md Sobahan Mia

Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed the 2023 sales data for Titash Products, transforming raw data into actionable insights. This process involved extensive data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, ultimately leading to an interactive dashboard that enables dynamic data exploration. The dashboard reveals key sales trends and insights across multiple dimensions, such as monthly sales, gender-based purchasing behavior, age groups, and regional performance.

Data Cleaning and Preparation
The initial dataset contained missing values in the "Category" column and irrelevant entries in various fields. To clean the data, I:

Used Excel formulas and filters to remove null and extraneous data.
Standardized entries with Excel's "Replace" function (e.g., converting "M" to "Men" and "W" to "Women").
Applied the TEXT formula to date fields, isolating months for detailed, month-by-month analysis.
These steps ensured consistent, usable data for in-depth analysis.

Data Organization and Visualization
Once cleaned, I used pivot tables to organize key performance metrics, such as:

Monthly sales and order counts.
Gender-based purchasing trends.
Regional distribution of sales.
Using these metrics, I created individual charts to visualize each insight and combined them into an interactive dashboard. The dashboard includes filters and a timeline slicer for enhanced user experience, allowing viewers to dynamically explore data across various time periods and categories.

Key Insights from the Dashboard
1. Sales vs. Order Count
Visualization: Combined line and bar chart.
Insight: Sales revenue and order volumes are displayed by month. A peak in sales occurred in early 2023, followed by a gradual decline toward year-end.
2. Sales by Gender
Visualization: Pie chart.
Insight: Women accounted for 64% of total sales, while men made up 36%. This emphasizes the potential to target female customers in marketing efforts.
3. Age Group and Gender Breakdown
Visualization: Bar chart.
Insight: Senior women are the highest-spending demographic, followed closely by adult women. This could guide age-targeted promotions and product recommendations.
4. Sales Channels
Visualization: Bar chart.
Insight: The top-performing sales channel was "Ajkerdeal" with over 10,000 orders, followed by "Daraz" and "Shopjoi." Prioritizing these channels could optimize order volume and revenue.
5. Top 5 Districts by Sales
Visualization: Horizontal bar chart.
Insight: Moulvibazar led in sales revenue, followed by Jamalpur and Netrokona. This insight supports regional marketing and inventory planning.
6. Order Status
Visualization: Donut chart.
Insight: 92% of orders were successfully delivered, while 8% comprised returns (3%), cancellations (3%), and refunds (2%). This indicates a high success rate, with minor areas for improvement in order processing and returns.
Interactive Dashboard Features
The dashboard includes filters and a timeline slicer, allowing users to dynamically explore data by time period, category, age group, gender, and sales channel. This level of interactivity enables users to gain deeper insights into sales trends, making the dashboard a valuable tool for data-driven decision-making.
